## General Information
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market.
- The US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 
- The company management wants to create a model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables and to understand the demand dynamics of the market using the model.
- The dataset being used contains a 2 yearly time series data of the demand of bikes and the variables such as season, weather, holiday, etc of every day.


## Conclusions
- The varaibles such as time/day, season and weather contribute significantly to the demand of the bikes.
